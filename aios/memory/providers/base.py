    """Filter candidate memories by ownership and sharing rules.

    Implements the decision matrix for cross-agent memory retrieval.
    Each candidate is kept or dropped based on the combination of
    ``user_id`` and ``sharing_policy`` supplied by the caller, plus
    the metadata stored on the memory itself.

    Safe defaults:
    - Missing ``sharing_policy`` in metadata → treated as ``"private"``
    - Missing ``owner_agent`` in metadata → never matches any agent

    Privacy invariant: a memory whose ``owner_agent`` differs from
    *agent_name* is **never** returned unless its metadata
    ``sharing_policy`` is exactly ``"shared"``.

    Args:
        candidates: Raw results from the provider's search.
        agent_name: The requesting agent's name.
        user_id: Optional user_id filter from query.params.
        sharing_policy: Optional sharing_policy filter from
            query.params.
        get_metadata: Callable that extracts a metadata dict from
            a single candidate item.  Must return a dict with keys:
            ``owner_agent``, ``user_id``, ``sharing_policy``.

    Returns:
        Filtered list of candidates that pass the sharing rules.
